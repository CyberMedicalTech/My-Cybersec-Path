# Infrastructure Security Scenario 1: Electrical Substation Security Plan

This scenario contains a detailed cybersecurity risk assessment plan for securing an electrical substation, based on **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** guidelines. The substation scenario involves high-voltage electrical switchgear that is not manned on a full-time basis and communicates via wireless signals.

## Risk Assessment 1: Applying the NIST Functions

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework has five core functions: **Identify**, **Protect**, **Detect**, **Respond**, and **Recover**. Below is how we would apply each function to the electrical substation scenario.

### 1. Identify (NIST ID.AM-1)
First, we need to create an inventory of all physical assets within the substation. These include:
- **Control Building**: Houses critical communication and control equipment.
- **345kV Shunt Reactor and Transformers**: Vital electrical equipment for power distribution.
- **Communication Systems**: Wireless radio signals, control devices, and network media.
- **Perimeter Security**: Gates, chain-link fences, and doors.

General Observation: The substation has critical devices that must be secured against unauthorized access and physical threats.

### 2. Protect (NIST PR.AC-2)
To protect the substation's assets, we could take the following actions:
- Install **physical barriers** like stronger fences and locked gates.
- Use **surveillance cameras** to monitor all entry points.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for access to control systems.
- Ensure that all **doors and gates are reinforced** to prevent forced entry.

---

### 3. Detect (NIST DE.CM-2, DE.CM-8)
To detect if someone is trying to tamper with or damage the substation's devices:
- Use **motion sensors** and **intrusion detection systems** (IDS) to monitor perimeter breaches.
- Deploy **real-time monitoring** of network traffic to detect unusual behavior.
- Implement **alerts** for any unauthorized physical or digital access attempts.

---

### 4. Respond (NIST RS.AN-1, RS.AN-2, RS.AN-3)
In case anomalies are detected:
- **Trigger alarms** that notify security teams immediately.
- **Isolate affected systems** to prevent further damage.
- **Conduct an investigation** to understand the scope of the threat and take action.

---

### 5. Recover (NIST RC.RP-1)
To recover from any security incident:
- Implement a **disaster recovery plan** to restore affected systems.
- Ensure that **backups** of control systems and configuration files are maintained.
- **Conduct a post-incident review** to improve future security measures.

---

### Summary
By following the NIST framework, we can build a security plan that ensures the substation is protected from both physical and digital threats. This includes identifying key assets, securing those assets, detecting any threats, responding to incidents, and recovering from attacks.
