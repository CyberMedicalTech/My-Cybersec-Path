# 👨🏾‍💻 Welcome to My Cybersecurity Journey

Hi! I'm Ari CyberMedicalTech, an Air Force veteran with a passion for continuous learning and all things tech. My career began as an aircraft mechanic, where I spent 12 years mastering technical systems and troubleshooting complex machinery. I then transitioned into biomedical technology, applying my hands-on skills to critical healthcare equipment. Now, I'm pursuing my next challenge in cybersecurity, driven by a passion for protecting systems and solving security challenges.
I'm teaching myself in my free time and documenting my journey to showcase my growth, projects, and resources. This profile will serve as a living record of my progress as I work towards becoming a cybersecurity professional.
